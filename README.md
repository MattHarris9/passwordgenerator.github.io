# passwordgenerator.github.io

Started by creating the variables for the upper case and lower caser letters, numbers and special characters

Then had to create the prompts asking the user for how long they want their password between 8-128 characters

Where they confirm or deny the letters picks a random sequendce of letters, numbers and characters

If they don't chose any the user will be asked to choose one of the options.

My code was long so I used:
developer.mozilla.org
w3schools.com
to help me re-write the code to make it more orginzed and put together

If the user chooses a number less then 8 or over 128 the user will be prompted to choose a number between them.
